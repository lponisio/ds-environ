### Lesson Overview

This lesson was written by Dr. Carl Boettiger, UC Berkeley. Part of his commitment to open science is to share his teaching materials (Thanks Carl!). Check out his [research group](https://www.carlboettiger.info/)

Part of this lesson is a bit of a scavenger hunt for trying to understand the publicly available data on climate monitoring. Some information on these datasets will be difficult to find, and hopefully inspire detailed meta-data documentation but everyone in this class in the future ;) In previous years, we have downloaded this data from online, but I worried that some data would be taken down so the data is included pre-downloaded.

### Demo: Evidence for Global Climate Change

In this module, we will explore several of the most significant data sources on global climate change.  An introduction to these data sources can be found at NASA's [Climate Vital Signs website](http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs).

 We will begin by examining the carbon dioxide record from the Mauna Loa Observatory.

**Why C02?**

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas, which is released through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels, as well as natural processes such as respiration and volcanic eruptions.

**Parsing tabular data**

One of the most common formats we will interact with is tabular data. Tabular data is often presented in *plain text*, which is not as simple as it sounds, (as we shall see in a moment).  NASA points us to a raw data file maintained by [NOAA on one of it's FTP servers](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt).

So, where does this data come from? How does one measure atmospheric CO2 levels anyway?

**Data Provenance**

Knowing where our data come from and how values are measured is essential to proper interpretation of the results.  Data scientists usually speak of *raw data* and *derived data*, but the intepretation of these terms is always relative.  Typically *raw* simply means "the data I started with" and *derived* "the data I produced."  Thus our "raw" data is almost always someone else's "derived" data, and understanding how they got to it can provide important insights to our analysis.  One of the first questions we should ask of any data is "where does it come from?"

In particular, we usually want to make note of three things:

- 1. What is the uncertainty in the data?
- 2. What is the resolution of the data?
- 3. What do missing values mean?

**1.  What is the uncertainty in the data?**

Almost all measurements come with some degree of uncertainty, or measurement error.  Often we will not be able to know this precisely. Rather, we seek a a qualtiative understanding of the measurement process to give us some idea of the relative importance of errors in the measurement process influencing the value.  We may later be able to infer a more precise description of measurement error from the data itself, but this will always require assumptions about both the data-generating process itself.

**2. What is the resolution of the data?**

Derived data often summarize raw data in some way.  For instance, global climate data is frequently reported as monthly or even annual averages, even though the raw data may be collected day by day, or even minute by minute.  Data may be averaged over space as well as time, such as weather measurements made in at separate stations.  Weighted averages and more complex techniques are often used as well.

**3. What do missing values mean?**

Real world data almost always has missing values.  Here, it is important we try to understand *why* values are missing so we know how to handle them appropriately.  If there is a systematic reason behind why data are missing (say, days where snowfall or storms made the weather station inaccessible) they could bias our analysis (underestimating extreme cold days, say).  If data are missing for an unrelated reason (the scientist is sick, or the instrument fails) then we may be more justified in simply ommitting the data.  Often we cannot know the exact reason certain data are missing and this is just something we must keep in mind as a caveat to our infererence. Frequently our results will be independent of missing data, and sometimes missing data can be accurately inferred from the data that is available.

**Measuring C02 levels**

So how *are* atmospheric CO2 levels measured?

Researchers shine an infrared light source of a precise intensity through dry air in a container of precisely controlled volume & pressure, ensuring a consistent number of atoms in the chamber. CO2 absorbs some of this radiation as it passes through the chamber, and then a sensor on the opposite end measures the radiation it receives, allowing researchers to calculate the amount absorbed and infer the CO2 concentration.  The data are reported in parts per million (ppm), a count of the number of CO2 molecules per million molecules of dry air.  These calculations are calibrated by comparing against chambers that are prepared using known concentrations of CO2.  For more information, see [NOAA documentation](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html).

**Measurement uncertainty:**

Importantly, the measurement error introduced here is rather small, roughly 0.2 ppm.  As we shall see, many other factors, such as local weather and seasonal variation also influence the measurement, but the measurement process itself is reasonably precise.  As we move to other sources of data these measurement errors can become much more significant.

**Resolution:**

What is the resolution of the CO2 data? Already we see our data are not the actual "raw" measurements the researchers at Mauna Loa read off their instruments each day, but have been reported as monthly averages.

**Missing values:**

The last column of the data set tells us for how many days that month researchers collected data.  We see that they only started keeping track of this information in 1974, but have since been pretty diligent -- collecting data almost every day of the month (no breaks for weekends here!  What do you think accounts for the gaps?  How might you test your hypothesis?  Would these introduce bias to the monthly averages? Would that bias influence your conclusion about rising CO2 levels?)

Spatially our Mauna Loa data has no aggregation -- the data is collected at only one location.  How might the data differ if it were aggregated from stations all over the globe?

**Importing Data**

**Goal.** Load the NOAA Mauna Loa monthly CO₂ file that is bundled with this lab at `data/co2_mm_mlo.txt`.

**Watch‑outs (why parsing is tricky):**
- Lines starting with `#` are **comments** that describe the columns.
- Some numeric columns use **sentinel codes** like `-9.99` to mean “missing” — we’ll convert those to real `NA`.
- The file includes a `decimal_date`, but we’ll also construct a proper **`Date`** from `year` + `month` for plotting.

We’ll first try a naive import (to see the problems), then a fix that **tells R about comments**, and finally a tidyverse‑style read that
**assigns column names**, **converts sentinels to `NA`**, and **adds a `Date` column**.

Our first task is to read this data into our R environment.  To this, we will use the `read.csv` function. Reading in a data file is called *parsing*, which sounds much more sophisticated.  For good reason too -- parsing different data files and formats is a cornerstone of all pratical data science research, and can often be the hardest step.

So what do we need to know about this file in order to read it into R?

```{r, render=print}
### Let's try:
co2.test1 <- read.csv(co2_path)
head(co2.test1)
```

hmm... what a mess.  Let's try defining the comment symbol:
```{r, render=print}
co2.test2 <- read.csv(co2_path,
                 comment = "#")
head(co2.test2)
```

Getting there, but not quite done. Our first row is being interpreted as column names.  The documentation also notes that certain values are used to indicate missing data, which we would be better off converting to explicitly missing so we don't get confused.

Seems like we need a more flexible way to load in the data to avoid further suffering. Let's try `readr::read_table` from `tidyverse` 

```{r}

co2 <- read_table(co2_path, comment = "#",
                  col_names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date", 
                                "average", "interpolated", "trend",
                                "stdev_days", "uncertainty_average"),
                  col_types = c("iidddidd"),
                  na = c("-1", "-99.99", "-9.99", "-0.99"))
co2
```

Success! We have read in the data. Celebrate!

### Plotting Data with `ggplot`

Effective visualizations are an integral part of data science, poorly organized or poorly labelled figures can be as much a source of peril as understanding.  Nevertheless, the ability to generate plots quickly with minimal tinkering is an essential skill.  As standards for visualizations have increased, too often visualization is seen as an ends rather than a means of data analysis. See [Fox & Hendler (2011)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/705.short) for more discussion of this.

```{r}
ggplot(co2, aes(decimal_date, average)) + geom_line()
```

**Alternative: Plotting Data with base R (no packages needed)**
If you want to plot something quickly without loading any packages. 

```{r}
plot(y=co2$average, x=co2$decimal_date, type="l",
     ylab="Average Co2", xlab="Decimal date")
```

But... it isn't quite as pretty as with ggplot. :/ 

**Plotting multiple series**

We often would like to plot several data values together for comparison,
for example the average, interpolated and trend $CO_2$ data. We can do
this in three steps:

1) subsetting the dataset to the columns desired for plotting

```{r}
co2_sub <- co2 %>%
    select(decimal_date, average, interpolated, trend)
co2_sub %>% head()
```


2) rearranging the data into a "long" data table where the data values
are stacked together in one column and there is a separate column that
keeps track of whether the data came from the average,
interpolated, or trend column. Notice by using the same name,
we overwrite the original co2_sub


```{r}
co2_sub <- co2_sub %>%
    pivot_longer(!decimal_date, names_to="series",
                 values_to="ppmv")
head(co2_sub)
```

3) Visualize the data using a line plot

```{r}
co2_sub %>%
 ggplot(aes(decimal_date, ppmv, col = series)) +
  geom_line()
```

Or we can take advantage of dplyr's nifty pipping abilities and
accomplish all of these steps in one block of code. Beyond being more
succinct, this has the added benefit of avoiding creating a new object
for the subsetted data.

```{r fig.height=3}
co2 %>%
  select(decimal_date, average, interpolated, trend) %>%
  gather(series, ppmv, -decimal_date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(decimal_date, ppmv, col = series)) +  geom_line()
```

**What do we see?**

Our "Figure 1" shows three broad patterns:

- A trend of steadily increasing CO2 concentration from 1950 to 2015
- Small, regular seasonal oscillation is visible in the data
- Increase appears to be accelerating (convex curve)

**Understanding moving averages**

**Trend, cycle, or noise?**

> "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"

Present-day climate data is often sampled at both finer temporal and spatial scales than we might be interested in when exploring long-term trends.  More frequent sampling can reveal higher-frequency trends, such as the seasonal pattern we observe in the CO2 record.  It can also reveal somewhat greater variability, picking up more random (stochastic) sources of variation such as weather patterns.

To reveal long term trends it is frequently valuable to average out this high-frequency variation.  We could spend the whole course discussing ways such averaging or smoothing can be done, but instead we'll focus on the most common methods you will see already present in the climate data we examine.  The monthly record data we analyze here already shows some averaging.  How was this performed?

**Moving averages**

```{r}
co2 %>%
 mutate(annual = RcppRoll::roll_mean(average,
                                     n=12L,
                                     align = "left",
                                     fill = NA,
                                     na.rm=TRUE,
                                     normalize=FALSE)) ->
  co2
head(co2)
```

```{r}
co2 %>% ggplot(aes(decimal_date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=average), col="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y=annual), col="red")
```

The [2013 IPCC Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SummaryVolume_FINAL.pdf) included a tentative observation of a "much smaller increasing trend" in global mean temperatures since 1998 than was observed previously.  This led to much discussion in the media about the existence of a "Pause" or "Hiatus" in global warming rates, as well as much research looking into where the extra heat could have gone.  (Examples discussing this question include articles in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/global-warming-hasnt-paused-study-finds), [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28870988), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus)).

### Demo: Exploring Seasonal Oscillations

Circling back to our CO2 data from Mauna Loa, let's practice summarizing our data in different ways. 

- Demonstrate that the periodic behavior truly is seasonal
- What month is the maximum? What is the minimum?
- What do you think could explain the seasonal cycle observed here?

```{r}
### Seasonal oscillation
co2 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  ### Note we need month[which.max] since not all years have all 12 months
  summarise(max_month = month[which.max(average)],
            min_month = month[which.min(average)]) %>%
  gather(id, value, -year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, fill=id)) + stat_count()
```

### Question 9 (Gradaute student or Extra credit) : Summarize the data of your choice.
