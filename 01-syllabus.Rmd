# Syllabus


## Course Overview

The course develops hands-on coding skills using spatial, temporal, species occurrence, and interaction data. Topics include:

- Reproducible workflows
- Hypothesis testing with simulations
- Networks analyses
- Regular expressions and data standardization
- Spatial data manipulation (GIS)
- Scientific communication and visualization

## The 7 Fundamentals (Wilson)

1. Individual things  
2. Commands that operate on things  
3. Groups of things  
4. Repetition (loops)  
5. Decision making (conditionals)  
6. Creating functions  
7. Combining functions (piping)

## Coding Tools and Practices
- RMarkdown for reproducibility
- Tidyverse for data wrangling and plotting
- Git + GitHub for collaboration
- Fundamentals of programming in R

Primary outside class materials: This book, *R for Data Science* (Grolemund & Wickham), online DataCamp tutorials.
