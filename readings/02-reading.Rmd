### Pre‑class reflection (please submit short answers via canvas)

1. In your own words, what does **computational reproducibility** mean? Give one concrete example from your work or coursework where results would *not* be reproducible without extra effort.
2. List **two benefits to you** (the analyst) and **two benefits to the community** of making your work reproducible.
3. Which barrier feels most real for you right now: **complexity**, **technological change**, **human error**, or **intellectual property**? Explain with a 2–3 sentence example.
4. Commit to **one specific step** you will implement in your current/future research (student thesis, etc.) (e.g., a file‑naming scheme, a README template, version control, dynamic documents). Why this step?

### In‑class small‑group prompts

*Before analysis:* data storage & organization:

- Sketch a **project folder layout** for the current/next lab (e.g., `data-raw/`, `data/`, `R/`, `figs/`, `doc/`).  
- Decide what belongs in **raw** vs **clean** data; outline a **metadata** plan (variables, units, data provenance).  
- Propose a **backup strategy** (locations, frequency) and a **file‑naming convention** that encodes version/date.

**Human error scenarios**
Consider: a collaborator overwrites a cleaned dataset; a figure is updated but not the manuscript numbers; code runs only on one laptop.  

- For **each**, describe how a reproducible workflow would **prevent or catch** the issue.

**Reproducibility checklist**

- Draft a **reproducibility checklist** (6–10 items) tailored to the current lab or for this class's final project. 

**Final thoughts** 

- One **question** you still have.
