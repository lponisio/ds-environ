### Individual reflection (short written responses)

1. Positionality: Who are you in relation to your study system/communities? Name one way your training, language(s), or passport access could shape your research questions or interpretations. 

2. Language & knowledge systems: Give one concrete step you could take this term to include non-English sources or local knowledge forms (e.g., oral histories, maps, artefacts) in your evidence base. Why that step? 

3. Historical context: Identify one colonial or post-colonial process that influenced the landscape/species you study. How might that history affect your hypotheses or sampling frame? 

4. Avoiding parachute science: Describe one design change that would move a hypothetical field study from extractive to reciprocal (planning, authorship, outputs, or funding flow). 


5. Authorship & credit: Propose an authorship/acknowledgement plan for a collaborative project that fairly credits local experts and knowledge holders. What trade-offs might you face? 

6. Ethical risks: Name a foreseeable harm (social, cultural, or ecological) your project could cause and a mitigation you would build in from day one. 

**In-class discussion (small groups → whole class)**

A. Case study: “Who benefits?”:
Scenario: You have rapid funding to analyze biodiversity data collected in a Global South region and stored in a Global North repository. Internet bandwidth is limited for local collaborators.

Discuss:

- Minimum co-design steps you must take before analysis begins.

- How you will handle data access & sovereignty (permissions, embargoes, community review).

- A fair authorship and outputs plan (local language summary, data dashboards, capacity funding). 


B. Choose two of the reflection questions and synthesize you reflections to report back to the group.
