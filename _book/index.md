# Welcome 

This book accompanies the Fall 2025 course **BI 410/510L - Data Science for the Environment**, taught by **Prof. Lauren Ponisio**. The course equips students with practical skills to reproducibly analyze environmental data.

## Acknolwedgements 

In the spirit of open science, many of these lessons were inspired by other courses, including [Carl Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info/) (Lab 2, Climate change), [Chris Paciorek](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/paciorek/)(regular expressions, debugging) [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) (Spatial labs, git).
